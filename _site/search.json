    "text": "Investment: The Key Driver of Growth\nFinding: Both models consistently show that investment (gross capital formation) has the strongest positive effect on GDP growth.\n\nPanel Model: A 1 percentage point increase in investment (as % of GDP) is associated with approximately 0.23 percentage points higher GDP growth\nCross-Sectional Model: Shows similar magnitude with 0.26 percentage points impact\nStatistical Significance: Highly significant across all specifications (p &lt; 0.001)\n\nEconomic Interpretation: This finding aligns with endogenous growth theory, where capital accumulation drives productivity improvements and sustained economic growth. Countries investing more in infrastructure, machinery, and technology experience faster growth rates."
